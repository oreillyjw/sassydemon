## sass "hot-compile" shell script
This script uses `inotify-tools` to monitor a specified `watch directory` for any changes to `.scss` files. It then runs `sass` on those files to compile it into `.css` and put the resulting CSS file into an (optional) output directory. _If no output directory is specified, it will output them to the same directory as the changed `.scss` file_

This eliminates the need to run `sass <file> <output_file>` every time you want to compile sass; it will do it on the fly for you whenever it detects a change in a scss file (in your watch directory). 

The script runs in "monitor mode", so you can leave it running and it will continuously wait for changes and emit the "modify" event to trigger the `sass` command to run.


### Basic Usage
`/bin/bash sassy_demon.sh -w scss/`

This will have the script watch the `scss/` directory for changes. Since no output directory was specified, the CSS file will go to the same place
```
$ /bin/bash sassy_demon.sh -w scss/
--------------------------
WATCHING DIRECTORY: scss/
WILL SEND OUTPUT TO: scss/

Setting up watches.  Beware: since -r was given, this may take a while!
Watches established.
```
_NOTE: Because the watcher is using a `-r` flag behind the scenes to look recursively for changes, `inotify` gives the warning that it may take a while. Once the watcher is established, it will show `Watches established.`, meaning it is running and watching your files_

When you make a change, the script will display the following:
```
********
scss/test/files/test_file.scss was modified

COMPILING: scss/test/files/test_file.scss
OUTPUT: scss/test/files/test_file.css

done.
**********
```

### Using Output Directory
`/bin/bash sassy_demon.sh -w scss/ -o css/`

This will have the script watch the `scss/` directory for changes and send the output to `css/`
```
$ /bin/bash sassy_demon.sh -w scss/ -o css/
--------------------------
WATCHING DIRECTORY: scss/
WILL SEND OUTPUT TO: css/

Setting up watches.  Beware: since -r was given, this may take a while!
Watches established.
********
scss/test/files/test_file.scss was modified

COMPILING: scss/test/files/test_file.scss
OUTPUT: css/test_file.css

done.
**********
```
_NOTE: When you specify an output directory, the CSS file will just go straight to that directory. If you want to maintain the subdirectories of the file changes, use the `-s` flag._

### Maintain Subdirectories
If you want the output to maintain the same subdirectories as the changed file, you can use the `-s` flag. This flag will maintain the subdirectories and make any directories that do not exist before putting the file there. _NOTE: If you do not specify an output directory, the script will maintain the subdirectories by default, so you do not need to use this flag_

#### WITHOUT THE -S FLAG (DEFAULT WHEN OUTPUT IS SPECIFIED)
```
$ /bin/bash sassy_demon.sh -w scss/ -o css/
--------------------------
WATCHING DIRECTORY: scss/
WILL SEND OUTPUT TO: css/

Setting up watches.  Beware: since -r was given, this may take a while!
Watches established.
********
scss/test/files/test_file.scss was modified

COMPILING: scss/test/files/test_file.scss
OUTPUT: css/test_file.css

done.
**********
```
#### WITH THE -S FLAG (DEFAULT WHEN OUTPUT IS NOT SPECIFIED)
```
$ /bin/bash sassy_demon.sh -w scss/ -o css/ -s
--------------------------
WATCHING DIRECTORY: scss/
WILL SEND OUTPUT TO: css/

OUTPUT WILL CONTAIN SUBDIRECTORIES

********
scss/test/files/test_file.scss was modified

COMPILING: scss/test/files/test_file.scss
OUTPUT: css/test/files/test_file.css

done.
**********
```

_Notice how the script maintains the subdirectories without the need for the `-s` flag if only a watch directory is specified_
```
$ bin/bash sassy_demon.sh -w scss/
--------------------------
WATCHING DIRECTORY: scss/
WILL SEND OUTPUT TO: scss/

COMPILING: scss/test/files/test_file.scss
OUTPUT: scss/test/files/test_file.css

done.

```

## DEPENDENCIES
- This script requires `inotify-tools` and `sass` to be installed.
- The script also uses the `sass --sourcemap=none --cache=false` command, so make sure you have those. If your version of sass does not support those flags, there is a commented out `sass` command in the script that does not use them, so you can use that instead.
- `inotify-tools` [Github Install page](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/wiki#getting)
- `sass` [Installation Guide](http://sass-lang.com/install)

## FLAGS
- `-w <path>` (required) - sets the watch directory
- `-o <path>` - sets the output directory
- `-s` - if an output path is specified, this will maintain the subdirectories of the changed file into the output directory
- `-h` - display the help documentation
